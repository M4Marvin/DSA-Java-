# Data Structures and Algorithms in Java 

---

This is my attempt to design and write implementations of some popular data structures and algorithms.

I have been learning basic java and Test Driven Development (TDD) for a while now, and I am very excited to share my progress on GitHub.

So all the implementations are written in Java using TDD. The following is a list of the data structures and algorithms that I am planning to implement:
(I'll more details about the specific implementations as I implement them.) 

    **Data Structures :**
        - Linked List
            -- Single Linked List
            -- Double Linked List
            -- Circular Linked List
        - Stack 
        - Queue
            -- Array List Queue
            -- Linked List Queue
            -- Circular Queue
            -- Priority Queue
            -- Deque
        - Tree
            -- Binary Tree
            -- Binary Search Tree
            -- AVL Tree
            -- Red-Black Tree
            -- Multi-way Seach Tree
            -- Trie
        - Graph
            -- Adjacency List
            -- Adjacency Matrix
            -- Adjacency Set
        - HashMap
        - Dynamic Array
        - Disjoint Set
        - Cache
        - Bag
        - Buffer
        - Bloom Filter
    
    **Algorithms :**
        - Conversion
        - Math
        - String
        - Searches
        - Sorting
        - Divide and Conquer
        - Dynamic Programming
        - Backtracking
        - Matrix Exponentiation
        - Misc
        - Minimizing Lateness
        - Cipher
        - Audio Filtering
        - Developer Utils

This is a basic list of the data structures and algorithms that I am planning to implement, which I got from [The Algorithms - Java](https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/Java).
I am planning to add more DSA implementations to this list as I learn more about them.
